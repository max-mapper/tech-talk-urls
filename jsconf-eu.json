         "description":"Sever Side JavaScript (especially Node.js) is a hot topic right now, but we are still figuring out what good SSJS code looks like. It isn't enough that we can write JavaScript on the server, or even that it is well written JavaScript. It's essential that we write maintainable JavaScript for the server environment. This talk will examine different coding styles for event driven, non-blocking SSJS and which styles are most successful.We'll take a look at strategies that other languages and frameworks with similar attributes such as Clojure, Erlang, Python/Twisted and Ruby/Event Machine use. From these languages we'll take a look what has worked well and what hasn't. We'll explore how these models can apply to JavaScript to create patterns that can be used to make code more maintainable.Since JavaScript is already an event driven language there is already a lot of support for events, and developers are used to developing code with the event driven browser. However, how we use these features on the server with it's additional freedom can either help or harm the long term use of our code. One of the obvious code defects created by poor use of the evented model in JavaScript is Pyramids. Pyramids are huge chains ofnested, dependant anonymous callbacks piled one on top of another until you end up with a pyramid of code, left to right. Pyramids are one of the first, obvious, mistakes people tend to make when beginning SSJS. We'll also discuss some of the less obvious ones and explore ways of avoiding them.About TomTom Hughes-Croucher ;is an Evangelist and Senior Developer in",

         "description":"One of the biggest challenges to the otherwise wonderful programming model of JavaScript is handling complex logic that involves lots of async functions and things that emit events. The inversion-of-inversion-of-inversion-of-control often needed is hard to read, write, and just plain understand.With pre-empetive multi-threading you delegate all control to the operating system and it handles concurrency for you. This comes at a great performance cost. However with JavaScript this simply isn't the model, there is one thread and finite snippets of code executed. There is nothing like being able to tell a computer exactly how much code to run and under what conditions and it just works under extreme load and/or concurrency.Be prepared to have your mind warped and molded as you are trained to not only accept this fact of life, but embrace it.

In fact, IE 5.5 was the first browser to offer data persistence in other forms than cookies. However, today, as we are online most of our time, handling offline situations has become important for many web apps. And for mobile dev, storage is crucial: You wouldn't want to pull some hundred k of data via a slow connection again and again.\"This talk will take a tour around existing client side storage mechanisms. We'll start with cookies and see why it's a bad place to stay. Then we'll quickly move on to the good neighbours, visiting ancient places as well as futuristic ones and investigating their ins and outs. And we'll also stop by the frameworks/wrappers that give easy access to them.

Nobody wants to choose a loser, and as demonstrated by super-meaningful Google graphs and surveys that count my grandfather's blog alongside leading web sites, jQuery is leaving all the other libraries in the dust. Plus, it's easy! And there's a plugin for everything! And with all those sites using it, finding someone who can write thoughtful, maintainable code with it will be totally no big deal. Right?This talk is a call to arms. This is not just JavaScript -- it's JavaScript, damnit, a language worthy of respect and, *gasp*, knowledgeable developers. When well-meaning but uninformed deciders and developers see jQuery as the be-all-end-all answer, conflating a knowledge of jQuery with a knowledge of JavaScript, we all lose. As a community, we owe it to the language -- and ourselves -- to give those deciders and developers the context they need to make well-informed decisions.

A new generation of applications such as Gmail and Office Web Applications use thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of lines of JavaScript to deliver functionality and complexity similar to traditional desktop applications. With the advent of AJAX and script libraries, nearly every new site today makes use of JavaScript. These changes have also pushed browsers and script engines to evolve rapidly to keep up with user and developer needs to have fast, responsive applications and sites.Internet Explorer 9 introduces a new JavaScript engine, codenamed Chakra, which fundamentally changes the performance characteristics of JavaScript inside Internet Explorer 9. We'll dive into what's new in Chakra, including the new compiler that compiles JavaScript source code into high-quality native machine code, a new interpreter for executing script on traditional web pages, and improvements to the JavaScript runtime and libraries like ECMAScript 5 support.About PetePete LePage works at Microsoft on the Internet Explorer team as a Senior Product Manager, helping developers take advantage of the web platform in Internet Explorer.

Differences aside, the web browser and the desktop are becoming more and more entwined and just generally faster. Now is our chance to make web applications that surpass the usefulness and awesomeness of desktop counterparts. Sure, there are technologies that allow you to bring desktop style code to the web. With ;Sammy.js, I'm more interested in creating web style apps that can compete as desktop experiences. Sammy.js is a very simple",

         "description":"This topic will cover the concept of what rapid prototyping is, why it is important in the design and development process, and how you can not only leverage the power of JavaScript to rapidly develop proof of concepts and prototypes, but build them with multiple devices in mind.Digging DeeperThe area of Research and Development (R&D) in software, web and user interface engineering is making quite a statement in many large and small scale organizations lately. With such a vast amount of data and web service APIs available to developers, coupled with a huge demand for multiple systems integrating seamlessly across several platforms and devices, it should come as no surprise that companies are creating \"Labs\" departments left and right to create the \"next big thing.\"In order to cultivate innovative products and services, designers and developers need to research, ideate, and collaborate to develop creative approaches to current products or services, or even fill voids for users for products or services that have not been created. Developers need to quickly build out prototypes of these ideas in order to not only implement the ideas and prove the value of the concept, but to also provide new products and/or services for the business itself (and keep the R&D department alive!).Rapid prototyping is exactly as it sounds: creating a prototype of a concept or an idea in a very short amount of time. For years, such rapid prototyping and development of various simulations was heavily dominated by the Flash and Actionscript world. Now, with the speed and power of current JavaScript interpreters and its ubiquity across arguably the most used piece of software known to man (the web browser), JavaScript, in harmony with HTML and CSS is quickly becoming a go to resource for hashing out proofs of concepts.From My Presentation, You Will Learn...What rapid prototyping is and why it is important.Some actual results of rapid prototyping (case studies) with JavaScript.What tools you can use right now to build rapid prototypes (including Titanium Desktop, Phonegap, CouchDB, Node.js, JavaScript Templating, Webview for Android and plain HTML5 and CSS3).Tips on baking in ideas like performance, scalability, and maintenance into the prototypes and why you should avoid them.How to utilize a single codebase for usage across various devices and platforms including the desktop browser, the mobile browser and mobility products (e.g. Ipad).About JoeJoe McCann, a Senior Technologist at ;frog design, works on innovative design initiatives including the building out of rapid prototypes for companies such as Hewlett Packard and other confidential clients. Joe is also the Principal Consultant at subPrint Interactive, the founder and curator of the Austin JavaScript meetup group, a staunch supporter of the open web and a complete data junkie. Joe's current technical interests lie with machine learning, sentiment analysis, Node.js, Phonegap and Android.",
